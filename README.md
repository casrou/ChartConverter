# ChartConverter
Convert any song mapped in BeatSaber to a chart playable in Clone Hero.

The [Blazor application](/src/ChartConverter.Blazor) takes a BeastSaber request code, then downloads and converts the map. Try it out [here](https://casrou.github.io/ChartConverter).

A sample [console application](/samples/ConsoleApplication) is also provided to demonstrate converting a downloaded BeastSaber zip-file to Clone Hero.
